# Route-Optimization-Around-Island-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
> This note record and share the final project of [GA course](https://timetable.nycu.edu.tw/?r=main/crsoutline&Acy=112&Sem=2&CrsNo=517408&lang=zh-tw) about developing an optimized route planning system for customized needs and deploying the result on website.

# Project Overview

## 1. Research Background and Purpose

### 1.1 Background and Motivation
We planned a budget-friendly 11-day motorcycle trip around Taiwan, aiming to calculate the optimal route that balances cost efficiency and enjoyment. The journey starts from National Chiao Tung University, traveling counterclockwise around Taiwan, focusing on scenic spots without considering accommodation or meals.

### 1.2 Literature Review
- **Factors Affecting Travel Quality:**  
  Huang (2007) identified three main factors: travel characteristics (attraction count, duration), route characteristics (distance, transport mode), and destination characteristics (stay time, attraction info). With the internet, travelers can customize trips based on these factors.
- **Multi-Day Travel Planning:**  
  Two methods: City model (filters out non-selected cities) and Central Point model (selects attractions within a radius from a central point).  
  Wang (2014) suggested decision factors like daily travel distance/time limits, combined into a linear function for optimization.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):**  
  The TSP seeks the shortest route visiting each city once and returning to the start. Metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA) offer near-optimal solutions efficiently, which we will use in this project.

### 1.3 Objective
We aim to calculate the optimal route using Google Maps API and a Genetic Algorithm, considering:
- **Attraction Rating:** Prioritizing higher-rated attractions.
- **Distance:** Minimizing actual riding distance.
- **Central Attractions:** Selecting attractions near major roads or of personal interest.

**Selected Central Attractions:**
- **Hsinchu:** Hsinchu City East District Roundabout
- **Miaoli:** Miaoli Gongguan
- **Taichung:** Fengyuan Mazu Temple, Taichung Park
- **Nantou:** Caotun Town Office
- **Yunlin:** Gukeng Green Tunnel
- **Chiayi:** Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum
- **Tainan:** Qigu Salt Mountain, Yuguang Island
- **Kaohsiung:** K≈çshan's Eye, Cijin Old Street
- **Pingtung:** Kenting National Park
- **Taitung:** Duoliang Station, Brown Avenue
- **Hualien:** Baxian Cave, Pacific Park
- **Yilan:** Qingshui Geothermal Park, Bambi Hills
- **New Taipei:** Wenshan Caotang, Shiding Crocodile Island
- **Taipei:** Rongjin Time Living Park, National Palace Museum
- **Taoyuan:** Senlin Riverside Caf√©, Daxi Old Street

## 2. Research Methodology

### 2.1 Building the Attraction Database
- **Central Points:** Google Maps API is used to find central attraction coordinates.
- **Nearby Attractions:** Using Google Maps API, we locate the top 10 high-rated attractions within a small radius, with at least 100 reviews.

### 2.2 Generating Distance Matrix
Using Google Maps API, we calculate distances between attractions, storing them in a 10x10 matrix for the TSP optimization, saved as a .txt file.

### 2.3 Optimal Route Generation
We use the following fitness function:
value = rating * 1 - total_distance

Rating is weighted higher than distance (1 vs. -1). The algorithm generates one route, which may have a reverse option, but we focus on a counterclockwise direction, favoring north-to-south paths along the west coast. Each county's "local optimal route" is combined to form the final "Best Round-the-Island Route."

### 2.4 Full Route Optimization
All data is consolidated into a single CSV file, removing initial restrictions for a more flexible, globally optimized route.
